        description: `
        Little Blue - or St Kilda Pier Kiosk - has been a fixture in the Melbourne landscape since 1859 when the pier first opened to the public. Operating as a restaurant since 1904, the site became a staple destination for families, couples and visitors alike - an ideal place to watch the fairy penguins play and enjoy a bite. Since it’s rehabilitation, the restaurant has continued to captivate and charm with an emphasis on mod-Aus cuisine, locally sourced and organic meats, fish, and vegetables and an extensive wine, beer, and cocktail list.
